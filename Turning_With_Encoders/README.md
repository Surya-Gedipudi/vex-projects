### The goal of this project is to use feedback from VEX Shaft Encoders to program the RECbot to turn accurately. The following swing and point turns should be executed: 180 degrees, 90 degrees, 60 degrees, 45 degrees, and 15 degrees.

#### Keep in Mind:

- The encoder count values vary for each degree for the RECbot.
- You must directly test the RECbot to see whether it produces a turn of your desired angle.
